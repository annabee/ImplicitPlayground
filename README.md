##### Embrace the Implicit

Implicits are often regarded with suspicion by developers, with some companies going as far as banning them from their codebases. Let's dive into how implicit conversions and parameters work in Scala. We will talk about design pattern where they can come in handy as well as scenarios where they should definitely be avoided. At the end of this session I’d like everyone to have a good idea about the power and the responsibility that comes with the “i-word”.
